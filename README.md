New in Town: Dimensions is an expansion pack for the popular base New in Town data pack, a multi-stage, story-driven, settler's experience. This expansion, in pre-release status, serves as a glimpse into the content you can expect to continue the story of New in Town, however, it is provided as a stand-alone experience. You do not need to have the New in Town data pack installed to explore these dimensions. However, the fleet and mine building experiences are only accessible with the base pack installed.


## New in Town: Dimensions features the following:
```
> Multiplayer compatibility; each player can open one portal to the In Between and travel amongst the different dimensions
> Four new and unique dimensions, as well as a peculiar method of traveling between them
> Play with or without the original New in Town; this pack is compatible with it, but independent
> A large and growing variety of naturally-generating structures, with varying complexities
> Room to grow; more structures, natural features, and story beats may be added in the future
> And more!
```
